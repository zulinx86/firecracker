    # =============================
    #
    # Guests on Intel Skylake or with T2S template
    # --------------------------------------------
    # Whether mmio_stale_data is marked as "Vulnerable" or not is determined by the code here.
    # https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.46/source/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/bugs.c#L431
    # Virtualization of FLUSH_L1D has been available and CPUID.(EAX=0x7,ECX=0):EDX[28 (FLUSH_L1D)]
    # has been passed through to guests only since kernel v6.4.
    # https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/da3db168fb671f15e393b227f5c312c698ecb6ea
    # Thus, since the FLUSH_L1D bit is masked off prior to kernel v6.4, guests with
    # IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.FB_CLEAR (bit 17) = 0 (like guests on Intel Skylake and guests with
    # T2S template) fall onto the second hand of the condition and fail the test. The value is
    # "Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode" on guests on Intel Skylake and guests
    # with T2S template but "Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT Host state unknown" on kernel v6.4
    # or later. In any case, the kernel attempts to clear CPU buffers using VERW instruction and it
    # is safe to ingore the "Vulnerable" message if the host has the microcode update applied
    # correctly. Here we expect the common string "Clear CPU buffers" to cover both cases.
    #
    # Guest on Intel Skylake with C3 template
    # ---------------------------------------
    # If the processor does not enumerate IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.{FBSDP_NO,PSDP_NO,SBDR_SSDP_NO},
    # the kernel checks its lists of affected/unaffected processors and determines whether the
    # mitigation is required, and if the processor is not included in the lists, the sysfs is marked
    # as "Unknown".
    # https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.50/source/arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c#L1387
    # The behavior for "Unknown" state was added in the following commit and older processors that
    # are no longer serviced are not listed up.
    # https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7df548840c496b0141fb2404b889c346380c2b22
    # Since those bits are not set on Intel Skylake and C3 template makes guests pretend to be AWS

    # this "Unknown" state.
