# Firecracker Integration Tests

The tests herein are meant to uphold the security, quality, and performance
contracts of Firecracker.

## Running

The testing system is built around [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
Our `tools/devtool` script is a convenience wrapper which automatically
downloads necessary test artifacts from S3, before invoking pytest inside a
docker container. For detailed help on usage, see `tools/devtool help`.

To run all available tests that would also run as part of our PR CI (e.g.
excluding tests marked with `pytest.mark.nonci`):

```sh
tools/devtool -y test
```

To run only tests from specific directories and/or files:

```sh
tools/devtool -y test -- integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py
```

To run a single specific test from a file:

```sh
tools/devtool -y test -- integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py::test_boottime
```

Note that all paths should be specified relative to the `tests` directory, _not_
the repository root.

Alternatively, pytest provides the option to run all tests where the test name
contains some substring via the `-k` option:

```sh
tools/devtool -y test -- -k 1024 integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py::test_boottime
```

This is particularly useful for specifying parameters of test functions. For
example, the above command will run all boottime tests with a microVM size of
1024MB.

If you are not interested in the capabilities of `devtool`, use pytest directly,
either from inside the container:

```sh
tools/devtool -y shell -p
pytest [<pytest argument>...]
```

or natively on your dev box:

```sh
python3 -m pytest [<pytest argument>...]
```

### Output

Output, including testrun results, goes to `stdout`. Errors go to `stderr`. By
default, stdout and stderr are captured while tests are running and are printed
in the final failure report only if they fail. To print them while running
regardless of success or failure, pass the `-s` flag, e.g.
`tools/devtool -y test -- -s`.

### Dependencies

- A bare-metal `Linux` host with `uname -r` >= 5.10 and KVM enabled (`/dev/kvm`
  device node exists)
- Docker
- `awscli` version 2

## Rust Integration Tests

The `pytest`-powered integration tests rely on Firecracker's HTTP API for
configuring and communicating with the VMM. Alongside these, the `vmm` crate
also includes several [native-Rust integration tests](../src/vmm/tests/), which
exercise its programmatic API without the HTTP integration. `Cargo`
automatically picks up these tests when `cargo test` is issued. They also count
towards code coverage.

To run *only* the Rust integration tests:

```bash
cargo test --test integration_tests --all
```

Unlike unit tests, Rust integration tests are each run in a separate process.
`cargo` also packages them in a new crate. This has several known side effects:

1. Only the `pub` functions can be called. This is fine, as it allows the VMM to
   be consumed as a programmatic user would. If any function is necessary but
   not `pub`, please consider carefully whether it conceptually *needs* to be in
   the public interface before making it so.

1. The correct functioning scenario of the `vmm` implies that it `exit`s with
   code `0`. This is necessary for proper resource cleanup. However, `cargo`
   doesn't expect the test process to initiate its own demise, therefore it will
   not be able to properly collect test output.

   Example:

   ```bash
   cargo test --test integration_tests
   running 3 tests
   test test_setup_serial_device ... ok
   ```

To learn more about Rust integration test, see
[the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#integration-tests).

## A/B-Tests

A/B-Testing is a testing strategy where some test function is executed twice in
different environments (the _A_ and _B_ environments), and the overall test
result depends on a comparison of these outputs of the test function in these
two environments. The advantage of A/B-testing is that it does not require the
specification of a ground truth to compare against. It is instead dynamically
generated by running the test function in environment _A_. Firecracker's
A/B-testing generally compares Firecracker binaries compiled from two separate
commits (e.g. an _A_ binary which is compiled from the HEAD of the main branch,
and a _B_ binary which is compiled from the HEAD of a pull request opened
against main).

We use this testing approach if a test's ground truth...

- ...can change due to influence external to the code base (e.g. a security test
  that fails if a CVE is published for one of our dependencies), or
- ...is too complex/changes too often to reasonably be contained in the code
  base (e.g. extensive performance benchmark results).

For examples of how to utilize A/B-testing inside an integration test, have a
look at our [A/B-Testing module](framework/ab_test.py) or our
[`cargo audit` test](integration_tests/security/test_sec_audit.py).

If such an A/B-Test is executed outside of the context of a PR (meaning there is
no canonical choice of _A_ and _B_ to be made), it will simply try to assert the
state of the environment in which it was executed (e.g. the `cargo audit` test
above when run on a PR will fail iff a newly added dependency has a known open
RustSec advisory. If run outside a PR, it will fail if any existing dependency
has an open RustSec advisory).

### Functional A/B-Tests

Firecracker has some functional A/B-tests (for example, in
`test_vulnerabilities.py`), which generally compare the state of the pull
request target branch (e.g. `main`), with the PR head. However, when running
these locally, pytest does not know anything about potential PRs that the commit
the tests are being run on are contained in, and as such cannot do this
A/B-Test. To run functional A/B-Tests locally, you need to create a "fake" PR
environment by setting the `BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST` and
`BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_BASE_BRANCH` environment variables:

```
BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST=true BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_BASE_BRANCH=main ./tools/devtool test -- integration_tests/security/test_vulnerabilities.py
```

### Performance A/B-Tests

Firecracker has a special framework for orchestrating long-running A/B-tests
which run outside the pre-PR CI. Instead, these tests are scheduled to run
post-merge. Specific tests, such as our
[snapshot restore latency tests](integration_tests/performance/test_snapshot_ab.py)
contain no assertions themselves, but rather they emit data series using the
`aws_embedded_metrics` library. When executed by the
[`tools/ab_test.py`](../tools/ab_test.py) orchestration script, these data
series are collected. The orchestration script executes each test twice with
different Firecracker binaries, and then matches up corresponding data series
from the _A_ and _B_ run. For each data series, it performs a non-parametric
test. For each data series where the difference between the _A_ and _B_ run is
considered statically significant, it will print out the associated metric.
Please see `tools/ab_test.py --help` for information on how to configure what
the script considers significant.

Writing your own A/B-Test is easy: Simply write a test that outputs a data
series and has no functional assertions. Then, when this test is run under the
A/B-Test orchestrator, all data series emitted will be picked up automatically
for statistical analysis.

To add a new A/B-Test to our post-PR test suite, add the corresponding test
function to [`.buildkite/pipeline_perf.py`](../.buildkite/pipeline_perf.py). To
manually run an A/B-Test, use

```sh
tools/devtool -y test --ab [optional arguments to ab_test.py] run <dir A> <dir B> --test <test specification>
```

Here, _dir A_ and _dir B_ are directories containing firecracker and jailer
binaries whose performance characteristics you wish to compare. You can use
`./tools/devtool build --rev <revision> --release` to compile binaries from an
arbitrary git object (commit SHAs, branches, tags etc.). This will create
sub-directories in `build` containing the binaries. For example, to compare
boottime of microVMs between Firecracker binaries compiled from the `main`
branch and the `HEAD` of your current branch, run

```sh
tools/devtool -y build --rev main --release
tools/devtool -y build --rev HEAD --release
tools/devtool -y test --no-build --ab -- run build/main build/HEAD --test integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py::test_boottime
```

#### How to Write an A/B-Compatible Test and Common Pitfalls

First, **A/B-Compatible tests need to emit more than one data point for each
metric for which they wish to support A/B-testing**. This is because
non-parametric tests operate on data series instead of individual data points.

When emitting metrics with `aws_embedded_metrics`, each metric (data series) is
associated with a set of dimensions. The `tools/ab_test.py` script uses these
dimension to match up data series between two test runs. It only matches up two
data series with the same name if their dimensions match.

Special care needs to be taken when pytest expands the argument passed to
`tools/ab_test.py`'s `--test` option into multiple individual test cases. If two
test cases use the same dimensions for different data series, the script will
fail and print out the names of the violating data series. For this reason,
**A/B-Compatible tests should include a `performance_test` key in their
dimension set whose value is set to the name of the test**.

In addition to the above, care should be taken that the dimensions of the data
series emitted by some test case are unique to that test case. For example, if
we have a boottime test parameterized by number of vcpus, but the emitted
boottime data series' dimension set is just
`{"performance_test": "test_boottime"}`, then `tools/ab_test.py` will not be
able to tell apart data series belonging to different microVM sizes, and instead
combine them (which is probably not desired). For this reason **A/B-Compatible
tests should always include all pytest parameters in their dimension set.**

Lastly, performance A/B-Testing through `tools/ab_test.py` can only detect
performance differences that are present in the Firecracker binary. The
`tools/ab_test.py` script only checks out the revisions it is passed to execute
`cargo build` to generate a Firecracker binary. It does not run integration
tests in the context of the checked out revision. In particular, both the _A_
and the _B_ run will be triggered from within the same docker container, and
using the same revision of the integration test code. This means it is not
possible to use orchestrated A/B-Testing to assess the impact of, say, changing
only python code (such as enabling logging). Only Rust code can be A/B-Tested.
The exception to this are toolchain differences. If both specified revisions
have `rust-toolchain.toml` files, then `tools/ab_test.py` will compile using the
toolchain specified by the revision, instead of the toolchain installed in the
docker container from which the script is executed.

### A/B-Testing in Buildkite

We run automated A/B-Tests on every pull request after merge, if the pull
request touches any rust code. The pipeline is generated by the
[`pipeline_perf.py`](../.buildkite/pipeline_perf.py) script. To manually
schedule an A/B-Test in buildkite, the `REVISION_A` and `REVISION_B` environment
variables need to be set in the "Environment Variables" field under "Options" in
buildkite's "New Build" modal.

### Beyond commit comparisons

While our automated A/B-Testing suite only supports A/B-Tests across commit
ranges, you can also use the scripts to manually run A/B-comparisons for
arbitrary environment (such as comparison how the same Firecracker binary
behaves on different hosts).

For this, run the desired tests in your environments using `devtool` as you
would for a non-A/B test. The only difference to a normal test run is you should
set two environment variables: `AWS_EMF_ENVIRONMENT=local` and
`AWS_EMF_NAMESPACE=local`:

```sh
AWS_EMF_ENVIRONMENT=local AWS_EMF_NAMESPACE=local tools/devtool -y test -- integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py::test_boottime
```

This instructs `aws_embedded_metrics` to dump all data series that our A/B-Test
orchestration would analyze to `stdout`, and pytest will capture this output
into a file stored at `./test_results/test-report.json`.

The `tools/ab_test.py` script can consume these test reports, so next collect
your two test report files to your local machine and run

```sh
tools/ab_test.py analyze <first test-report.json> <second test-report.json>
```

This will then print the same analysis described in the previous sections.

#### Troubleshooting

If during `tools/ab_test.py analyze` you get an error like

```bash
$ tools/ab_test.py analyze <first test-report.json> <second test-report.json>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/firecracker/tools/ab_test.py", line 412, in <module>
    data_a = load_data_series(args.report_a)
  File "/firecracker/tools/ab_test.py", line 122, in load_data_series
    for line in test["teardown"]["stdout"].splitlines():
KeyError: 'stdout'
```

double check that the `AWS_EMF_ENVIRONMENT` and `AWS_EMF_NAMESPACE` environment
variables are set to `local`. Particularly, when collecting data from buildkite
pipelines generated from `.buildkite/pipeline_perf.py`, ensure you pass
`--step-param env/AWS_EMF_NAMESPACE=local --step-param env/AWS_EMF_SERVICE_NAME=local`!

## Adding Python Tests

Tests can be added in any (existing or new) sub-directory of `tests/`, in files
named `test_*.py`.

### Fixtures

By default, `pytest` makes all fixtures in [`conftest.py`](../tests/conftest.py)
available to all test functions. You can also create `conftest.py` in
sub-directories containing tests, or define fixtures directly in test files. See
the [`pytest` documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html) for
details.

Most integration tests use fixtures that abstract away the creation and teardown
of Firecracker processes. The following fixtures spawn Firecracker processes
that are pre-initialized with specific guest kernels and rootfs:

- `uvm_plain_any` is parametrized by the guest kernels
  [supported](../docs/kernel-policy.md) by Firecracker and a read-only Ubuntu
  24.04 squashfs as rootfs,
- `uvm_plain` yields a Firecracker process pre-initialized with a 5.10 kernel
  and the same Ubuntu 24.04 squashfs.
- `uvm_any` yields started microvms, parametrized by all supported kernels, all
  CPU templates (static, custom and none), and either booted or restored from a
  snapshot.
- `uvm_any_booted` works the same as `uvm_any`, but only for booted VMs.

Generally, tests should use `uvm_plain_any` if you are testing some interaction
between the guest and Firecracker, and `uvm_plain` should be used if Firecracker
functionality unrelated to the guest is being tested.

### Markers

Firecracker uses two special
[pytest markers](https://pytest.org/en/7.4.x/example/markers.html) to determine
which tests are run in which context:

- Tests marked as `nonci` are not run in the PR CI pipelines. Instead, they run
  in separate pipelines according to various cron schedules.
- Tests marked as `no_block_pr` are run in the "optional" PR CI pipeline. This
  pipeline is not required to pass for merging a PR.

All tests without markers are run for every pull request, and are required to
pass for the PR to be merged.

## Adding Rust Tests

Add a new function annotated with `#[test]` in
[`integration_tests.rs`](../src/vmm/tests/integration_tests.rs).

## Working With Guest Files

There are helper methods for writing to and reading from a guest filesystem. For
example, to overwrite the guest init process and later extract a log:

```python
def test_with_any_microvm_and_my_init(test_microvm_any):
    # [...]
    test_microvm_any.slot.fsfiles['mounted_root_fs'].copy_to(my_init, 'sbin/')
    # [...]
    test_microvm_any.slot.fsfiles['mounted_root_fs'].copy_from('logs/', 'log')
```

`copy_to()` source paths are relative to the host root and destination paths are
relative to the `mounted_root_fs` root. Vice versa for `copy_from()`.

Copying files to/from a guest file system while the guest is running results in
undefined behavior.

## Example Manual Testrun

Running on an EC2 `.metal` instance with an `Amazon Linux 2` AMI:

```sh
# Get firecracker
yum install -y git
git clone https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker.git

# Run all tests
cd firecracker
tools/devtool test
```

## CI Environment

In our CI, integration tests are run on EC2 `.metal` instances. We list the
instance types and host operating systems we test in
[our `README`](../README.md#tested-platforms). Multiple test runs can share a
`.metal` instance, meaning it is possible to observe noisy neighbor effects when
running the integration test suite (and particularly, tests should not assume
the ability to configure host-global resources). The exception to this are
integration tests found in
[`integration_tests/performance`](integration_tests/performance). These tests
are always executed single-tenant, and additionally tweak various host-level
setting to achieve consistent performance. Please see the `test` section of
`tools/devtool help` for more information.

## Terminology

- **Testrun**: A sandboxed run of all (or a selection of) integration tests.
- **Test Session**: A `pytest` testing session. One per **testrun**. A
  **Testrun** will start a **Test Session** once the sandbox is created.
- **Test**: A function named `test_` from this tree, that ensures a feature,
  functional parameter, or quality metric of Firecracker. Should assert or raise
  an exception if it fails.
- **Fixture**: A function that returns an object that makes it very easy to add
  **Tests**: E.g., a spawned Firecracker microvm. Fixtures are functions marked
  with `@pytest.fixture` from a files named either `conftest.py`, or from files
  where tests are found. See `pytest` documentation on fixtures.
- **Test Case**: An element from the cartesian product of a **Test** and all
  possible states of its parameters (including its fixtures).

## FAQ

`Q1:` *I have a shell script that runs my tests and I don't want to rewrite
it.*\
`A1:` Insofar as it makes sense, you should write it as a python test function.
However, you can always call the script from a shim python test function. You
can also add it as a microvm image resource in the s3 bucket (and it will be
made available under `microvm.slot.path`) or copy it over to a guest filesystem
as part of your test.

`Q2:` *I want to add more tests that I don't want to commit to the Firecracker
repository.*\
`A2:` Before a testrun or test session, just add your test directory under
`tests/`. `pytest` will discover all tests in this tree.

`Q3:` *I want to have my own test fixtures, and not commit them in the repo.*\
`A3:` Add a `conftest.py` file in your test directory, and place your fixtures
there. `pytest` will bring them into scope for all your tests.

`Q4:` *I want to use more/other microvm test images, but I don't want to add
them to the common s3 bucket.*\
`A4:` Add your custom images to the `build/img` subdirectory in the Firecracker
source tree. This directory is bind-mounted in the container and used as a local
image cache.

`Q5:` *How can I get live logger output from the tests?*\
`A5:` Accessing **pytest.ini** will allow you to modify logger settings.

`Q6:` *Is there a way to speed up integration tests execution time?*\
`A6:` You can narrow down the test selection as described in the **Running**
section. For example:

1. Pass the `-k substring` option to pytest to only run a subset of tests by
   specifying a part of their name.
1. Only run the tests contained in a file or directory.

## Implementation Goals

- Easily run tests manually on a development/test machine, and in a continuous
  integration environments.
- Each test should be independent, and self-contained. Tests will time out,
  expect a clean environment, and leave a clean environment behind.
- Always run with the latest dependencies and resources.

### Choice of Pytest & Dependencies

Pytest was chosen because:

- Python makes it easy to work in the clouds.
- Python has built-in sandbox (virtual environment) support.
- `pytest` has great test discovery and allows for simple, function-like tests.
- `pytest` has powerful test fixture support.

## Test System TODOs

**Note**: The below TODOs are also mentioned in their respective code files.

### Features

- Use the Firecracker Open API spec to populate Microvm API resource URLs.
- Event-based monitoring of microvm socket file creation to avoid while spins.
- Self-tests (e.g., Tests that test the testing system).

### Implementation

- Looking into `pytest-ordering` to ensure test order.
- Create an integrated, layered `say` system across the test runner and pytest
  (probably based on an environment variable).
- Per test function dependency installation would make tests easier to write.
- Type hinting is used sparsely across tests/\* python module. The code would be
  more easily understood with consistent type hints everywhere.

### Bug fixes

## Further Reading

Contributing to this testing system requires a dive deep on `pytest`.

## Troubleshooting tests

When troubleshooting tests, it is important to only narrow down the ones that
are of interest. One can use the `--last-failed` parameter to only run the tests
that failed from the previous run. Useful when several tests fail after making
large changes.

### Run tests from within the container

To avoid having to enter/exit Docker every test run, you can run the tests
directly within a Docker session:

```sh
tools/devtool -y shell --privileged
tools/test.sh integration_tests/functional/test_api.py
```

### How to use the Python debugger (pdb) for debugging

Just append `--pdb`, and when a test fails it will drop you in pdb, where you
can examine local variables and the stack, and can use the normal Python REPL.

```
tools/devtool -y test -- -k 1024 integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py::test_boottime --pdb
```

### How to use ipython's ipdb instead of pdb

```sh
tools/devtool -y shell --privileged
export PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--pdbcls=IPython.terminal.debugger:TerminalPdb
tools/test.sh -k 1024 integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py::test_boottime
```

There is a helper command in devtool that does just that, and is easier to type:

```sh
tools/devtool -y test_debug -k 1024 integration_tests/performance/test_boottime.py::test_boottime
```

### How to connect to the console interactively

There is a helper to enable the console, but it has to be run **before**
spawning the Firecracker process:

```python
uvm.help.enable_console()
uvm.spawn()
uvm.basic_config()
uvm.start()
...
```

Once that is done, if you get dropped into pdb, you can do this to open a `tmux`
tab connected to the console (via `screen`).

```python
uvm.help.tmux_console()
```

### How to reproduce intermittent (aka flaky) tests

Just run the test in a loop, and make it drop you into pdb when it fails.

```sh
while true; do
    tools/devtool -y test -- integration_tests/functional/test_balloon.py::test_deflate_on_oom -k False --pdb
done
```

### How to run tests in parallel with `-n`

We can run the tests in parallel via `pytest-xdist`. Not all tests can run in
parallel (the ones in `build` and `performance` are not supposed to run in
parallel).

By default, the tests run sequentially. One can use the `-n` to control the
parallelism. Just `-n` will run as many workers as CPUs, which may be too many.
As a rough heuristic, use half the available CPUs. I use -n4 for my 8 CPU
(HT-enabled) laptop. In metals 8 is a good number; more than that just gives
diminishing returns.

```sh
tools/devtool -y test -- integration_tests/functional -n$(expr $(nproc) / 2) --dist worksteal
```

### How to attach gdb to a running uvm

First, make the test fail and drop you into PDB. For example:

```sh
tools/devtool -y test_debug integration_tests/functional/test_api.py::test_api_happy_start --pdb
```

Then,

```
ipdb> test_microvm.help.gdbserver()
```

You get some instructions on how to run GDB to attach to gdbserver.

## How to run tests with a different version of Firecracker

The integration tests usually compile Firecracker as part of the test
initialization. But there's an option in case we want to run the tests against a
different version of Firecracker, for example a previous release:

```sh
./tools/devtool test -- --binary-dir ../v1.8.0
```

The directory specified with `--binary-dir` should contain at least two
binaries: `firecracker` and `jailer`.

## How to run tests outside of Docker

Tested in Ubuntu 22.04 and AL2023. AL2 does not work due to an old Python (3.8).

```sh
# replace with yum in Fedora/AmazonLinux
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install pytest ipython requests psutil tenacity filelock "urllib3<2.0" requests_unixsocket aws_embedded_metrics pytest-json-report pytest-timeout
cd tests
sudo env /usr/local/bin/pytest integration_tests/functional/test_api.py
```

> :warning: **Notice this runs the tests as root!**

## Sandbox

```sh
tools/devtool -y sandbox
```

That should drop you in an IPython REPL, where you can interact with a microvm:

```python
uvm.help.print_log()
uvm.get_all_metrics()
uvm.ssh.run("ls")
snap = uvm.snapshot_full()
uvm.help.tmux_ssh()
```

It supports a number of options, you can check with `devtool sandbox -- --help`.

### Running outside of Docker
